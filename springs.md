# Spring vs Spring MVC vs Spring Boot

<< [Home](README.md)

Spring, Spring MVC, and Spring Boot are all part of the Spring ecosystem, each serving a specific purpose and building upon each other to provide a comprehensive solution for Java-based application development.

## Spring Framework: 
The Spring Framework is a powerful and flexible Java-based application framework that aims to simplify the development and deployment of Java applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model, emphasizing inversion of control (IoC) and dependency injection (DI) principles. This helps developers create modular, testable, and scalable applications with ease. The Spring Framework also offers a wide range of features, such as data access, transaction management, validation, and support for building web applications and RESTful APIs.

## Spring MVC: 
Spring MVC is a module within the Spring Framework that specifically targets web application development. It is a powerful and flexible Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for building Java-based web applications and RESTful APIs. Spring MVC builds upon the core features of the Spring Framework, providing additional components and tools to handle HTTP requests and generate responses. With its pluggable architecture, Spring MVC allows developers to customize various aspects of the framework, such as view resolution, data binding, and validation. It also integrates seamlessly with other Spring modules, making it easy to develop full-featured web applications with a consistent programming model.

## Spring Boot: 
Spring Boot is a separate project built on top of the Spring Framework, designed to simplify the process of developing, deploying, and managing Spring applications. It provides a set of conventions and defaults, along with an opinionated approach to application configuration, which helps developers get started quickly and minimizes boilerplate code. Spring Boot includes features like auto-configuration, embedded web server support, and a wide range of starter modules for common use cases, such as data access, security, and caching.

Spring Boot also integrates with Spring MVC, making it easy to develop web applications and RESTful APIs using a consistent and simplified programming model. By leveraging Spring Boot, developers can focus on writing business logic and rely on the framework to handle much of the application setup and configuration.

In summary, the Spring Framework is the foundation that provides a comprehensive programming model and a rich set of features for Java application development. Spring MVC is a module within the Spring Framework targeting web application development, while Spring Boot is a separate project that simplifies the development, deployment, and management of Spring applications. Together, these technologies form a powerful ecosystem that allows developers to create robust, scalable, and maintainable Java-based applications with ease.

<li>Doesn't provide an opinionated setup, defaults, or embedded web server.</li>
<li>Doesn't handle web-specific tasks or auto-configuration.
</li></td>
        <td>Ideal for Java-based applications, including web applications, RESTful APIs, and enterprise applications.</td>
        <td>Moderate, depending on prior Java experience and understanding of core concepts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Spring MVC</th>
        <td>Offers a flexible MVC framework for building web applications and RESTful APIs with seamless integration with other Spring modules.</td>
        <td>
            <li>Doesn't cover non-web application development.</li>
            <li>Doesn't simplify application setup and configuration like Spring Boot, auto-configure, or provide embedded web servers</li>
        </td>
        <td>Best for web applications and RESTful APIs that require custom configuration and flexibility.</td>
        <td>Moderate to high, depending on familiarity with the Spring Framework and web development concepts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Spring Boot</th>
        <td>Simplifies the development, deployment, and management of Spring applications with opinionated defaults, auto-configuration, and embedded web server support.</td>
        <td>
            <li>Doesn't act as a replacement for the Spring Framework or Spring MVC</li>
            <li>Doesn't offer the same level of customization and flexibility as the core Spring Framework.</li>
            <li>Doesn't provide core features like IoC and DI, which come from Spring</li>
        </td>
        <td>Perfect for rapid development of web applications, microservices, and RESTful APIs with minimal setup and configuration.</td>
        <td>Relatively low, due to the simplified setup and conventions; however, it's beneficial to have some background in Spring Framework.</td>
